# Nudge Evidence Briefing

Nudge Evidence Briefing (NEB) documents are one-page summaries that encapsulate essential information about primary studies related to **nudges**.

The structure of NEBs includes key elements such as a concise title, the objective of the briefing, and a main section that addresses the context, desired behavior, nudges used in the study, and cognitive barriers and biases. The structure also includes results and conclusions, along with an information box specifying the nudge category, target audience, context, and relevant materials.

The NEB is an effective approach for synthesizing and presenting scientific evidence, supporting the use of scientific knowledge by industry and facilitating research replication by academia in integrating nudges into practical contexts.
